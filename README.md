# **Game Finder Project**

## About

Hi! Welcome to my Game Finder repository. The objective of this project is to learn while doing. Here I will show what I can do in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This web app is used to search for games and have information about them.

## Currently have:

- Complete HTML structure.
- Complete CSS styling.
- Email validation.
- Show/hide password functionality
- Working carrousel with five options of backgrounds.
- Login functionality.
- Connection with rawg.io API to get data.
- Show that data in rendered cards.
- Search functionality.
  -Responsive.
  -Light mode only in main page.
  -Show a column of one game or change it back to three with a toggle.
  -Last searches.

## To do list:

-Light mode in login. Got some problems implementing it the way a wanted. Maybe it is a bad approach or maybe the design I made (my first ever webpage [and I'm pretty proud about it]) is too hard coded and static.
-Modal to show details of selected game. Got the structure and style and functionality, but is not properly working, it's under development in "develop" branch.
-Search by console.
-Improve accessibility.
-Page optimization.
